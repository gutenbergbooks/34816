<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="dropcap"><span class="caps">As</span> the following pages are intended only for private circulation among
friends and acquaintances, and for presentation to those few Public
Societies to whom such a subject may be interesting, it is hardly
necessary to offer any apology for the many imperfections in the
description of Maes-howe, which may doubtless be pointed out, and for the
brief and cursory manner in which the subject is handled. I desire only to
give a plain statement of facts, in the hope that attention may be drawn
to this interesting discovery, and possibly some further impetus given to
the elucidation of Runic literature. I have received from the learned
professors, whose translations are given, much valuable information, of
which, however, I can only partially avail myself, in consequence of my
very imperfect acquaintance with Runology.</p>

<p>I may add, that every possible care has been taken to ensure accuracy in
the drawings. These and the ground plans were made by Mr. Gibb of
Aberdeen&mdash;of whose care and accuracy in the drawings of ancient monuments
Mr. Stuart has spoken so strongly in his &#8220;Sculptured Stones of Scotland,&#8221;
printed for the Spalding Club. The Runes were mostly drawn by my friend
Mr. George Petrie of Kirkwall, and the drawings afterwards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span> compared by
Mr. Gibb with the originals in the building of Maes-Howe. Two separate
sets of casts were made for me by Mr. Henry Laing of Edinburgh (one of
which is now in the National Museum of the Antiquaries of Scotland,
Edinburgh, and the other in the Museum of the Royal Northern Society of
Antiquaries at Copenhagen.) Nothing could exceed the pains taken by Mr.
Petrie and Mr. Gibb; and the drawings made by Mr. Gibb were on two
occasions collated by him with the casts in Edinburgh, so that I have
every reason to believe that they are as perfect representations of the
original writings on the walls of Maes-Howe as can be hoped for, and not
the less so that the gentlemen who made the drawings and collations were
unacquainted with Runes. I have confined myself to the interpretations
furnished by the three eminent northern antiquaries who have undertaken
the task of deciphering these rude inscriptions, feeling assured that the
high reputation which they enjoy is a sufficient guarantee for the
accuracy of their translations. In concluding these few remarks I am
anxious to bear testimony to the valuable assistance I have received from
my friend Mr. John Stuart, Secretary of the Society of Antiquaries of
Scotland, to whom in reality I am chiefly indebted for the discovery of
Maes-Howe, since I owe to his urgent suggestion that the great circle of
Stennes, and the tumuli around it, had not been sufficiently examined, the
successful excavation of this ancient &#8220;howe.&#8221; It is also highly
satisfactory to me to know that Mr. Balfour of Balfour and Trenabie, on
whose property this interesting relic of antiquity is situated, has taken
the necessary steps to ensure its preservation&mdash;a precaution,
unfortunately, too often neglected under similar circumstances.</p>

<h2>MAES-HOWE.</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="dropcap"><span class="caps">Early</span> in the month of July 1861 I was enabled, by the kind permission of
my friend David Balfour, Esq. of Balfour and Trenaby, to put in execution
a scheme long contemplated, but from various circumstances unavoidably
delayed, the excavation of some of the great tumuli in the neighbourhood
of the Stones of Stennes, or Ring of Brogar. I had in the year 1854
partially explored one of considerable size on the east side of the great
circle of stones, which stands on the west shore of the Loch of Harray. No
discovery, however, of any importance was then made.</p>

<p>Some days were devoted to excavations close to Stennes, to which allusion
will afterwards be made, but as several gentlemen of well-known
antiquarian reputation from Edinburgh and Aberdeen were expected, and as I
was desirous of having the benefit of their experience and advice, I
determined at once to commence operations on the great tumulus of
Maes-howe, the subject of this notice. My attention had been particularly
called to this tumulus by Mr. Balfour, whose decided opinion that a
careful examination might result in some important discovery, afforded me
great encouragement, as I well knew that he had for many years taken
considerable interest in Orkney antiquities, and his opinion that
Maes-howe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span> was a sepulchral chamber, appeared to be confirmed by local
traditions.<small><a name="f1.1" id="f1.1" href="#f1">[1]</a></small></p>

<p>On the afternoon of Saturday the 6th of July, therefore, guided by the
experience of Mr. George Petrie, and assisted by the professional
knowledge of Mr. Wilson, road contractor, ground was broken on the west
side of Maes-howe, and on the same evening, Mr. John Stuart and Mr. Joseph
Robertson of Edinburgh, with Colonel Forbes Leslie of Rothie, and Mr.
James Hay Chalmers of Aberdeen, arrived by the Prince Consort steamship.
As it was anticipated that a couple of days would suffice to make a large
opening in the tumulus, arrangements were made for meeting there on the
10th of July. Before proceeding with the description of what followed, it
may not be out of place to give a short account of the Stones of Stennes,
as described by Lieutenant Thomas in a work published by him in 1851:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Great Circle of Stennes, or Ring of Brogar, is a deeply entrenched
circular space containing almost two acres and a half of superficies, of
which the diameter is 366 feet. Around the circumference of the area, but
about thirteen feet within the trench, are the erect stones, standing at
an average distance of eighteen feet apart. They are totally unhewn, and
vary considerably in form and size. The highest stone was found to be 13-9
feet above the surface, and judging from some others which have fallen, it
is sunk about eighteen inches in the ground. The smallest stone is less
than six feet, but the average height is from eight to ten. The breadth
varies from 2-6 to 7-9 feet, but the average may be stated at about 5
feet, and the thickness about 1 foot&mdash;all of the old red sandstone
formation. The trench round the area is in good preservation. The edge of
the bank is still sharply defined, as well as the two foot-banks or
entrances, which are placed exactly opposite to each other. They have no
relation to the true or magnetic meridian, but are parallel to the general
direction of the neck of land on which the circle is placed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span> The trench
is 29 feet in breadth, and about 6 in depth, and the entrances are formed
by narrow earth-banks across the fosse. The surface of the enclosed area
has an average inclination to the eastward. It is highest on the
north-west quarter, and the extreme difference of level is estimated to be
from 6 to 7 feet. The trench has the same inclination, and therefore could
never be designed to hold water.&#8221;</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span class="smcap">The Excavation of Maes-Howe.</span></h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Monday the 8th of July, a number of men under the superintendance of
Alexander Johnson, Mr. Wilson&#8217;s foreman&mdash;a most active and intelligent
fellow&mdash;proceeded with the work that had been commenced on the previous
Saturday, and before evening discovered a passage on the west side, which
afterwards proved to be the entrance into the interior of the tumulus.
This passage was covered over with large flag-stones, one of which having
been with some difficulty upraised, we effected an entrance, but found a
considerable accumulation of earth and stones, which was removed on the
following day, and Mr. Wilson, after careful examination, in which his
engineering experience was of the highest importance, agreed to my
suggestion that the excavation should be proceeded with from the centre of
the hillock.</p>

<p>I am chiefly indebted to my friend Mr. George Petrie for the following
measurements, which I believe will be found to be substantially correct:&mdash;</p>

<p>The tumulus is about 92 feet in diameter, 36 feet high, and about 300 feet
in circumference at the base. It is surrounded by a trench 40 feet wide,
and varying in depth from 4 to 8 feet. It is situated on the north side of
the new road leading to Stromness from Kirkwall, being about 6 miles from
the former, and 9 from the latter place. It is about 200 yards distant
from the road, and a mile and a half from the Stones of Stennes. It has
undoubtedly been entered at some remote period, probably by the Northmen,
who, as is well known, were not deterred by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span> feelings either of religion
or superstition, from opening and ransacking any place likely to repay
them for their trouble. Whether they were the first to break into the
building, or whether they found it in a state of comparative ruin, the
natural result of great antiquity, can now only be matter of conjecture.
It is obvious that little respect has been paid to the dead, since the
stones used for closing up the cells, in which it is supposed they were
deposited, were found torn out and buried in the mass of ruins filling up
the interior of the chamber to which these cells are attached.</p>

<p>The passage leading to the central chamber is 2 feet 4 inches wide at its
mouth, and appears to have been the same in height, but the covering
stones had been removed, or had fallen in for about 22&#189; feet. The
passage then increases in dimensions to 3&#188; feet in width, and 4 feet 4
inches in height, and continues for 26 feet, when it is again narrowed by
two upright stone slabs to 2 feet 5 inches. These slabs are each 2 feet 4
inches broad, and immediately beyond them the passage extends 2 feet 10
inches, and then opens into the central chamber. Its dimensions from the
slabs to its opening into the chamber are 3 feet 4 inches wide, and 4 feet
8 inches high. At the commencement of the passage there is a triangular
recess in the wall about 2 feet deep, and 3&#189; in height and width, in
front and opposite to it in the passage, a stone of corresponding shape
and dimensions, suggesting the idea that it might have been used to close
the passage, and that it was pushed back into the recess in the wall when
admission into the chamber was desired. From this recess to the chamber,
the sides of the passage, the floor and roof, are formed by four immense
slabs of flagstone; three of these stones are broken, and the fourth
slightly cracked.</p>

<p>After a few days&#8217; labour the whole of the rubbish filling the chamber was
removed, but long ere this was accomplished, the keen eye of Mr. Joseph
Robertson discovered the first of the Runic inscriptions. They were high
up on the walls of the building, smaller and less distinctly drawn than
many that were afterwards discovered, but the important fact of the
existence of Runic inscriptions in Orkney, where none had hitherto been
found, was at once established.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Plate II.</span> INTERIOR VIEW OF MAESHOWE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>The chamber when cleared out proved to be about 15 feet square on the
level of the floor, and 13 feet in height, to the top of the present
walls. Immediately opposite to the passage is an opening in the wall 3
feet from the floor. This is the entrance to a cell or small chamber in
the wall, 5 feet 8 inches long, 4&#189; feet wide, and 3&#189; high. A large
flagstone is laid as a raised floor between the entrance and the inner end
of the chamber. The entrance is 2 feet wide, 2&#189; high, and 22&#189; inches
long. On the two opposite walls of the chamber are similar openings in the
walls. The one on the right is 2&#189; feet wide, 2 feet 9 inches high, and
1 foot 8 inches long. It gives admission to a cell 6 feet 10 inches long,
4 feet 7 inches wide, 3&#189; feet high, and has a raised flagstone floor,
as in the other chamber. The opening on the left is 2&#188; feet wide, 2&#189;
high, and 1&#190; long, and about 3 feet above the floor of the chamber. The
cell of which this is the entrance is 5 feet 7 inches long, 4 feet 8
inches wide, and 3 feet 4 inches high. It has no raised floor like the two
other cells. The roofs, floors, and back walls of the cells are each
formed by a single slab of stone, and stones corresponding in size and
shape to the openings in the walls were found on the floor in front of
them. The natural inference is that they were originally the seals of the
chambers in which the honoured dead reposed.</p>

<p>The four walls of the central chamber converge towards the top by the
successive projection of each stone or flag, commencing about 6 feet from
the level of the floor, as is usually found to be the style of building,
both in the Pict&#8217;s houses or burghs, and in the still more primitive
subterranean dwellings known as Weems. The top of the chamber would thus
necessarily be of small dimensions, and the aperture easily closed by one
large flagstone. This top, or cover stone, together with a considerable
portion of the upper part of the walls, has been thrown down, and the
highest part of the existing walls is only about 13 feet from the level of
the floor. At that point, the opposite walls have approached to within 10
feet of each other, so that the chamber is now 15 feet square at the
floor, and 10 feet at the top of the walls, in their present condition.</p>

<p>Large quantities of earth had been piled up over the building when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>completed. In each angle of the central chamber stands a large buttress,
doubtless intended to strengthen the walls, and support them under the
pressure of their own weight, and that of the mass of earth with which the
whole was covered. These buttresses vary somewhat in dimensions, but they
are on an average about 3 feet square at the base, and from 9 to 10 feet
high, with the exception of one which is only 8 feet high. In each
buttress one side is formed by a single slab. The walls of the chamber are
built with large stones, which generally extend the whole length of the
wall. No lime or mortar of any kind has been used.</p>

<p>The entire number of Runic characters may be about 935, exclusive of
scribbles and many doubtful marks. The monograms and bind-runes, or
connected consonants, are considered as forming one letter. There are also
some marks which may have been intended to represent a horse and an otter
with a fish in its mouth; also, a winged dragon and a worm knot, which
last has much the appearance of one of the great Saurians. The two hind
legs are very plainly defined.</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span class="smcap">Barrows at Bookan.</span></h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This barrow is in the parish of Sandwick, but so near to Stennes that it
may have been regarded as connected with the great circle. It is on the
property of Mr. Watt of Skail, in the West Mainland. It was opened on the
6th of July, and proved to be a collection of kists or graves. At the
north end of the central kist, a flint lance head, and several fragments
of clay vessels or urns, were found, together with a lump of heavy metal,
supposed to be Manganese, but no bones. In some of the other kists were
human remains in a very decayed state, two jaw bones being the most
perfect. These were much distorted.</p>

<p>Mr. Petrie gives me the following measurements:&mdash;The Barrow is about 44
feet in diameter, and about 6 feet high. About 11 feet within the outer
margin of the base of the barrow is a circular wall or facing about 1 foot
high. From the south side of this wall a low passage, 6 feet 3 inches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
long, 21 inches in height, and the same in width, leads to a chamber or
kist 7 feet long and 4&#189; wide. At the north end of this there was
another kist 4 feet 8 inches long, and 3 feet wide. On the east side there
was one 4 feet 8 inches long, and 2 feet 9 inches wide; and on the west
side two kists, both of which were of the same length as that on the east
side, and both were 3 feet in width. They were all about 2 feet 8 inches
deep. The foundation of the surrounding wall or facing was considerably
above the level of the floors of the kists.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>LARGE BARROW CONTAINING GRAVES.</h3>

<p>The excavation of this barrow was commenced on the 17th of July 1854. It
was found to contain graves, in one of which was an urn with a quantity of
burnt bones and ashes. It was formed out of a micaceous stone not
belonging to Orkney. It was 1 foot 9 inches in diameter, about 18 inches
deep, and 5 feet 10 inches in circumference, the rim, which projected on
the outside all round, was an inch and a half wide, the kist in which it
was deposited was 2 feet and a half in length, and 2 feet in width, but
the side stones which protected the kist were nearly 6 feet in length, and
at the angles, and on the outside of the kist were quantities of small
rolled pebbles and gravel, probably intended to assist in draining off
water. Clay was placed inside the kist at the different angles; the flags
were about an inch and a half thick, but much decayed; the cover stone was
of an irregular shape, about 4 feet long and 2&#189; wide; the urn rested
upon the corners of four flags; it was partly decayed, and could not be
removed till after an interval of two days, when I succeeded in raising
it. It is now in the Museum of the Society of Antiquaries at Edinburgh, to
whom I presented it, with the consent of Mr. Balfour.</p>

<p>In another grave within the same barrow was found a small urn composed of
baked clay and gravel, nearly filled with soil, and only one or two small
pieces of bone. It was brought to Kirkwall, but could not be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span> preserved,
in consequence of its decayed condition. It was 5 inches in diameter, 17
in circumference, and 5 deep. The kist was 2 feet 9&#189; inches long, and 1
foot 7 inches wide. The bones, in this instance, had not been placed in
the urn, but were laid on a flagstone in the north-west angle of the kist.
It is not improbable that further investigation might lead to the
discovery of other interments within the same barrow, since neither of
those before described were in the centre of the tumulus, and several
instances have occurred where they have been found near the outside.</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span class="smcap">Mounds at Stennes.</span></h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the year 1854, I had partially opened one of the largest of these
hillocks, but further examination last July did not encourage the belief
that it was sepulchral. I was however advised to examine one on the west
side of the Stones of Stennes, and directly opposite to the one previously
mentioned. In both of them the workmen penetrated to a depth of 22 feet,
and over an area of 9 square feet in the one on the west side of the great
circle, but there was no appearance of any kind of building. The material
of which these hillocks are composed is precisely the same as that which
still exists within the circle of stones, and I infer that when the moat
surrounding the circle was excavated, advantage was taken of the
circumstance to raise these hillocks. Fragments of animal, but no human
bones, were found in each, but in both instances near the top. Building
stones are found at the base of both hillocks, but always embedded in the
soil; those which were easy of removal having no doubt been long since
taken away by the country people. Sections were made at right angles in
both of the hillocks, and it was clearly ascertained that no building of
any size could be concealed within.</p>

<p>In this barrow, which is in the parish of Sandwick, but adjoining Stennes,
I found the remains of two stone urns. The barrow had been evidently
previously opened. There was reason to believe that these urns had been in
separate kists. They were formed out of a micaceous stone, but the attempt
to unite the fragments was quite hopeless. A few small pieces of human
bone were found. The cover and sidestones of the kists remained in the
grave.</p>

<h2>APPENDIX.</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Origin of Maes-Howe.</i></div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="caps">It</span> is proposed now to inquire into the origin of Maes-Howe, at what time,
and for what purpose it was constructed, and who were the people whose
names and writings are found engraved on its walls. I am indebted to the
learned Professors who have furnished me with their translation of the
inscriptions, for the information which is embodied in the following
pages.</p>

<p>It is much to be regretted that the inscriptions are so indefinite, and
frequently so much defaced. Moreover, Nos. 19 and 20 alone make any
allusion to the erection of Maes-Howe. Professor Rafn believes that it was
a sorcery hall for Lodbrok,<small><a name="f2.1" id="f2.1" href="#f2">[2]</a></small> a female magician, Professor Munch, that it
was the burial-place of a woman of the same name, while Professor
Stephens, who expresses no opinion as to the time when the building was
raised, considers the writings which speak of Lodbrok&#8217;s sons, as
indicative of its having been used in early times by the celebrated
Scandinavian Vikings of that name, as a fortress and place of retreat. The
low and narrow cells, as well as the low passage leading to the interior,
fully justify the opinion that it was undoubtedly at one time a place of
burial. The massive stones forming the floor and side walls of the
passage, and also those used in the inside to support the buttresses, are
similar in character to the neighbouring circle of stones at Stennes. The
architecture also is most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span> primitive, and it is evident that the whole
work must have been one requiring much time and labour. The present form
of the mound does not favour the idea that it was <i>originally</i> a platform,
and used for the performance of religious rites, though this would not be
inconsistent with the idea that it had been adopted to that purpose at
some remote period, having been previously used as a place of interment.</p>

<p>If we find difficulty in determining the period when the mound was first
raised, almost equal difficulty arises in assigning to any fixed time the
engraving of the numerous inscriptions. Many of them are no doubt to be
attributed to the Crusaders, but there are others of probably far earlier
date than the twelfth century, when, as stated by Professor Munch, the
Orkney Jarl, Ragnvald, about the year 1152-3, organized his naval
expedition to the Holy Land. That the writings have been engraved at
intervals during a long period of time&mdash;perhaps, as suggested by Professor
Stephens, during the ninth, tenth, and eleventh centuries, or even
later&mdash;is sufficiently obvious. Some of the stones have the words very
faintly and imperfectly engraved, while in others the lines are sharply
and distinctly cut. The absence of division between the letters (for the
<i>dots</i> are very uncertain in their position, and are probably for the most
part accidental) sufficiently accounts for the difference of reading, in
several of the inscriptions. The variety of type&mdash;there being no fewer
than 18 different forms of A, many of them it is true, <i>like</i>, but still
<i>different</i>; to say nothing of Diphthongs, the Bind-runes, or consonants
and vowels connected, as <img src="images/rune1_pg22.png" alt="" /> (&aelig;) or <img src="images/rune2_pg22.png" alt="" /> (a) and
<img src="images/rune3_pg22.png" alt="" /> (k) <img src="images/rune4_pg22.png" alt="" /> or
(a) and (<img src="images/rune5_pg22.png" alt="" />) forming AK, Ar, and others of a similar
nature&mdash;necessarily renders the task of translation, more especially when
the letters are indistinct and perhaps unfinished, one of difficulty and
uncertainty.</p>

<p>Very few of the <i>old</i> Northern letters are found. The &#8220;Dragon&#8221; and &#8220;Worm
Knot&#8221; are still perfectly distinct, and have evidently been carved by
superior artists. With the exception of two stones&mdash;one of which is shewn
in the drawing of the interior of the tumulus, and on which four letters
are carved&mdash;none have been found bearing any inscription amongst the
debris, nor is there any reason to suppose that stones bearing
inscriptions have been removed from the walls. The two stones before
alluded to had evidently been used to close up the cells, and lay on the
basement floor just below the entrances to the cells from which they had
been rudely torn. In one of the cells, that on the left side of the
chamber, a few letters were indistinctly written. By accident they were
forgotten, and no casts were taken of them. It is not easy to account for
the various elevations at which the carvings were made. Those on the
higher parts could not have been reached by persons standing at the
bottom, but they might have been inscribed after the roof had been broken
in, and when the building was in a partially ruined state. Many of the
marks, possibly some of the &#8220;scratches&#8221; or &#8220;scribbles&#8221; to which no
importance is attached, and perhaps even some of the doubtful letters, may
be the result of violence used in breaking in the roof. Most of the Runes
belong to the Norwegian division of the Scandinavian class, and have
nothing to do with the Gothic or older alphabet, but, in the opinion of
Professor Munch, they exhibit some archaicisms which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span> prevent their being
placed in the latest times of the Norwegian class; they must therefore be
referred to about <span class="smcaplc">A. D.</span> 1150.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Date of Inscriptions.</i></div>

<p>The meaning of the word Maes-Howe is very obscure. It is, as Professor
Munch remarks, not easy to explain. The haugr, pronounced how, is plain
enough; the word Maes might have been derived from Meitis, pronounced
almost like Meiss, Meitir, gen. Meiris, which was the name of a fabulous
sea king, and was afterwards used to denominate any mighty king or
warrior. Meiris-haugr therefore might have been synonymous with the how,
or tumulus of this fabulous sea king. This opinion of Professor Munch&#8217;s is
at all events not unlikely to be correct; certainly local tradition has
always ascribed a sepulchral character to the mound. Professor Rafn thinks
that the word is derived from Mar,<small><a name="f3.1" id="f3.1" href="#f3">[3]</a></small> the name of a man, and that valuable
information might be obtained if it were found possible to read with a
greater degree of accuracy the Runes Nos. 6 and 7, since Orki and Mar are
named in these inscriptions, and it is to be inferred that Mar Orkason had
engraved some of these Runes.</p>

<p>Nos. 13 and 20 are justly attributed to the times of the Crusaders,<small><a name="f4.1" id="f4.1" href="#f4">[4]</a></small> but
many of the other inscriptions must have been engraved by different
persons at different times. Professor Stephens believes that most of them
are of a much earlier date than the twelfth century, and this opinion is
much strengthened by the worn appearance of some of the Runes, and the
uncertain character of others. Some of the proper names cannot be read as
certainly correct, owing to the marks and abrasures in the stones. Two of
them, Orki and Oframr, are supposed to be hitherto quite unknown, and may
therefore perhaps be referred to the earlier inhabitants of the How,
whilst Gawkr and Trandill both belong to an historical person in Iceland.
The other names are common, and known from Runic inscriptions, as well as
from ancient manuscripts and documents. The name Ingibiorg, occurs several
times in the Orkneyinga Saga, and was by no means an uncommon name in
Orkney. Ingibiorg, the widow of earl Thorfinn (who died in 1064)
afterwards married Malcolm, king of Scotland; but it cannot be safely
asserted that this was the Ingibiorg mentioned in No. 8. On the whole, it
seems not unreasonable to suppose that all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span> names found inscribed on
the walls may belong to persons who lived since the construction of the
barrow, and that we have as yet no certain evidence to justify us in
determining either the name of the builder, or the period when the tumulus
was first erected.</p>

<p>Most of the inscriptions are in the subjoined form of the later Runic
alphabet, or the &#8220;Norwegian division of the Scandinavian Runes&#8221; as
described by Professor Munch. The dots inside the B, and G, do not occur
here, and the <img src="images/rune1_pg24.png" alt="" /> (y) is not often used.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/runes.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the earlier or &#8220;Gothic&#8221; Alphabet, many of the letters are quite
different.</p>

<p>This is only a fragment, some of the letters being obliterated. It may
mean that a pirate or Wicing had been at the tumulus and found something,
or that some person had found what the Wicing had left. It may however be
merely the name of some person, as Vikingr is sometimes used as a

<p>This is the Scandinavian Runic Futhork, or Alphabet. The form of the
second letter is very rare, the last three are also very unusual, and may
be considered as an indication that the building had been for a long
period of time in the hands of many people. It was the custom to write the
Alphabet wherever it was most likely to meet the eye, and a passing
visitor, or treasure seeker, would have hardly taken so much

<p>The Runic Alphabet&mdash;Some of the letters here have been placed out of their

Time has also produced its effects upon the letters, the &#449; is clearly
<img src="images/rune1_pg27.png" alt="" />, and the long stroke in the third letter <img src="images/rune2_pg27.png" alt="" /> (th) is also

<i>Orkason said in the Runes which he wrote&mdash;Nuari, Kulturmr Sikurthr, Iru, are fallen.<br />Kiaebik will say ye (tell you) so more.</i></p>

<p>These two inscriptions must be taken together; they have been written at
the same time, and by the same person. It is probably a military message
from some battle-field, sent through a trusty officer who is commissioned
to make known the details. The word Nuari is very doubtful; this part of
the inscription is very indistinct. It becomes more legible advancing from
left to right.&mdash;Professor <span class="smcap">Stephens</span>.</p>

<p class="center"><br /><span class="smcap">Orkasonr sagthi a run om theim er halir ristu.</span><br />
<br />
<i>The son of Orca dictated the Runes which heroes engraved.</i></p>

<p>There seems to have been some blunder in the writing. If the dot on the
right side of the letter <img src="images/rune1_pg28.png" alt="" /> has been the end of a stroke, it would
convert the letter into the Bind-rune <img src="images/rune2_pg28.png" alt="" /> (Al.) and if the <img src="images/rune3_pg28.png" alt="" /> were
a combination of L and R, the word would then read Halir, that is
Men-fellows-heroes. The second part of the inscription, No. 7, is only a

<br />
<i>Ingibiorgh, the fair lady. Many a woman hath fared skinclad (or bent) here, (who) great wealth owned.</i></p>

<p>Ingibiorgh probably resided here for safety, and, as the word Lutin
signifies <i>bent</i>, it may refer to the low cells which are within the walls
of the How. (<i>Note.</i>&mdash;The entrance also is very low and narrow.) The six
Crypt Runes, or secret staves, represent the letters, A. &AElig;. R. L. I. K.

<br />
<i>Ingiburg, the fair widow! Many a woman has wandered stooping in here (although) ever so haughty.</i></p>

<p>The writer is probably recording the name of some fair woman, who has
perhaps slighted him, and then reflects that the women who had been buried
here, though ever so haughty, had been curbed by death. Ingibjorg, or
Inkibiorh, is a common female name in the north. The other characters in
the third line are known as Limouna, or Bough Runes. They were used in the
later times of the Runic period, in the same manner as the Irish Ogum, but
are not here intelligible. The writer probably intended to represent the
chief vowels&mdash;A. E. I. O. Y. U. The Runic alphabet was divided into
classes; the strokes on the left of the vertical line indicating the
class, and those on the right the rune itself. Figures of fishes were
occasionally in use, and were known as Fish-runes.&mdash;Professor <span class="smcap">Munch</span>.</p>

<p>The Palm-runes underneath cannot be read in the usual manner; the first,
third, and fourth of the runes being a, o, and i; the writer probably
intended to give all the vowels, but some of the letters have been
obviously miscarved, and have perhaps been altered and defaced at a later
period by other persons. In the first of them a cross line has been added
to shew that the letter <img src="images/rune1_pg29.png" alt="" /> or (a) is intended.&mdash;Professor <span class="smcap">Rafn</span>.</p>

<p><a name="f1" id="f1" href="#f1.1">[1]</a> The country people state that the building was formerly inhabited by a
person named Hogboy, possessing great strength. Haugbuie, in Norse,
signifies &#8220;the ghost of the tomb;&#8221; and Haugr, &#8220;tumulus.&#8221;</p>

<p><a name="f2" id="f2" href="#f2.1">[2]</a> Professor Rafn says Lothbrok&mdash;a pair of shaggy trousers&mdash;was the
well-known surname of Ragnar Lodbrok. At the time of the carving of the
inscription, a popular tradition current in the Orkneys may have ascribed
to far antiquity, and to the said hero of the mythico-historical times,
the construction of the barrow; and on account of the want of historical
knowledge, since the word lothbrok is of feminine gender, the hero may
have been mistaken for a woman, and besides, the accounts in the sagas of
his sons may have been repeated, that they were brave and valiant. The
account given in the Fridthiofs Saga of the Earl Angantyre, reminds us of
the pre-historic times of the Orkneys (<i>vide</i> Tridthj&oacute;ss Saga, c. 5.
Thorsteins Saga Vikings). Here a popular tale preserved to us in Runes,
does the same by telling us that this barrow was the sorcery platform
erected of old for the use of Lodbrok, and was probably also a temple and
place of worship.</p>

<p><a name="f3" id="f3" href="#f3.1">[3]</a> The word read by Professor Rafn, Maur, instead of Mar, and considered
as a proper name, is read mair or more by Professor Stephens. In the
engraving No. 7, the letters are <img src="images/rune1_fn3.png" alt="" /> obviously
m, a, i, r&mdash;mair. It must therefore be a matter of doubt whether we can
receive this word as a proper name, and consequently whether the
derivation of the word Maes-Howe, suggested by Professor Rafn, is
admissible.</p>

<p><a name="f4" id="f4" href="#f4.1">[4]</a> Professor Munch supposes that the Jerusalem travellers, who are
described in No. 13 as having broken into the how, were connected with an
expedition organized by Earl Ragnvald to the Holy Land. He says &#8220;many of
the northern warriors joined the Earl in 1152. They assembled in Orkney,
and after passing the winter there, sailed in the spring of 1153, and
after being in Spain in December of that year, reached the Holy Land in
August 1154; they went thence to Constantinople, where they passed the
Christmas of 1154-55, returning home by different routes. During their
stay in Orkney they had frequent quarrels with the inhabitants.&#8221; As some
of the inscriptions seem to indicate the existence of treasure in the
tumulus, it is not unlikely that it should have been examined by these
warriors, and that they afterwards inscribed their names, together with
other remarks, on the walls.</p>

<p><a name="f5" id="f5" href="#f5.1">[5]</a> There is a similar allusion to hid treasure on the wall of a rock at
Berrig, in the Star valley North Throndheim County&mdash;&#8220;gull faitu nin alna
nither&#8221;&mdash;They hid some gold nine ells deep in the earth.</p>

<p><a name="f6" id="f6" href="#f6.1">[6]</a> This (&#8220;evidently very difficult carving,&#8221; says Professor Stephens) may
be taken as a fair specimen of the Bind-rune form of writing.</p>

<p>&#8220;The first letter is B, a very rare form; the second an ornamental O, with
three side strokes instead of two; the third a T, the strokes being
